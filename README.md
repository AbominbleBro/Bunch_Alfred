# Bunch For Alfred
This workflow takes advantage of Brett Terpstra's [Bunch Application](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/). 

Bunch is a workspace loader that you can use to quickly open/close applications, urls, documents, and more to come. 

This workflow utilizes Bunch's URL Scheme `x-bunch:[BUNCH NAME]`. 

And gives you all the bunches in your default bunches folder ("~/bunches")


## Directions:

* `b - Top Level Bunch Selector`
* `b <bunch filename>` - Runs the Selected Bunch
* `b edit <bunch filename>` - Opens the File in the Default Application
* `b display <bunch filename>` - Displays the contents of the Bunch in Large Text
* `b refresh` - Refreshes your Bunch List (It does this by opening the app so you will be in the Bunch app once the workflow completes.)
